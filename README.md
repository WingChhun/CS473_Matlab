# CS473_Matlab
Repository for my CS473- Introduction to Machine Learning class. This class is fairly difficult and I will be uploading my solutions/incompleted solutions to homework assignments to this repository, as well as a folder for Matlab Practices 

## Objective(s)

- Learn how to use Matlab in correlation to Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks
  - Learn how to use Matlab for Linear Algebra and statistics
  - Pass class

## Resources for Practice
 - My professor does not teach Matlab at all so have to entirely learn on my own, I think this is the most useful course to use
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_ekAD7U-wU&t=1293s
 - Matlab code within my Practice/Learning directory is from following along this video
 
## Notes

- Will be uploading prompts, some of my programs may be incomplete.
